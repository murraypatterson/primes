# primes
To compare the naive way of computing prime numbers to the sieve of Eratosthenes

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/murraypatterson/primes)](https://repl.it/github/murraypatterson/primes)

Choose Language `Haskell` (so that GHC is present).  After the Replit
loads, you can open up a `Shell` from `Tools` (by default, the `Shell`
tab is next to the `Console` tab already) and run

    $ bash run.bash

to run a time trial between the naive way and the sieve way
